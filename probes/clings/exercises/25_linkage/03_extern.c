 * It tells the compiler about the variable's type and name without
 * allocating memory for it. This allows multiple parts of a program
 * to share the same global variable.

 * Task: The variable 'level_difficulty' is defined at the bottom of
 * this file. Declare it at the top using 'extern' so that main()
