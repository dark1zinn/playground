# Types and Casting

C is a statically typed language. Every variable has a type that is determined at compile time. Sometimes you need to convert a value from one type to another, which is called "casting".

## Integer Division
One common pitfall in C is integer division. If you divide two integers, the result is always an integer, even if you assign it to a floating-point variable. The fractional part is simply discarded (truncated).

```c
float x = 5 / 2; // x will be 2.0, not 2.5
```

To get a floating-point result, at least one of the operands must be a floating-point type. You can achieve this by using a cast:

```c
float x = (float)5 / 2; // x will be 2.5
```

## Signed vs Unsigned

Mixing signed and unsigned integers in comparisons can lead to surprising results because the signed value is converted to unsigned.

```c
int s = -1;
unsigned int u = 1;
// s is converted to unsigned, so this comparison is false.
bool less = (s < u);
```

Use a cast or unify the types before comparing.

## Integer Promotions

Smaller integer types like `char` and `short` are promoted to `int` in most expressions. The promotion happens before the operation, but assigning back to a smaller type can still truncate the result. Use a wider type for intermediate values when you need the full range.
