# Enums and Typedefs

In C, you can define your own types to make your code more readable and easier to maintain.

## Enums
An `enum` (enumeration) is a custom type that allows you to assign names to integer constants. This makes your code more self-documenting.

```c
enum Day {
    SUNDAY,
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY
};
```

## Typedefs
The `typedef` keyword allows you to create an alias for an existing type. This is often used with structs to avoid having to write `struct` every time you declare a variable.

```c
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

Point p = {10, 20};
```
