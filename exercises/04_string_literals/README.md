# String Literals

In C, a string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

Example: `"Hello, world!"`

Technically, string literals are stored as an array of characters in a read-only section of memory. 
They are automatically null-terminated by the compiler, meaning a `\0` character is added to the end.
